Introduction
------------

The GSIP mediator service is a simple LOD (Linked Open Data) resolution
service for persistent identifiers.  Its role it to provide a description of a
Non-Information URI (URI that represents "things" as an hypermedia document (HTML, RDF/XML, TTL and JSON-LD)
that links this resource to information resources (actual document) in various
formats and links to other non-information resources.

For example, a real world catchment is assigned a non-information URI that is
unique to this thing.

https://geoconnex.ca/id/catchment/02OJ*CE

By convention, non-information URI are assigned a uri that is structured as
such

`http(s)://{domain}/id/{category}/{item}`

`/id/` is not a requirement of LOD, but it a mandatory convention for GSIP.
